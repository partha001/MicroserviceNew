					Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
					industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text
					ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
					and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not
					only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
					remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
					with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
					passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
					Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. <br> <br>
					Where does it come from? Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is
					not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin
					literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard
					McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in
					Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
					consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the
					cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
					undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and
					1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good
					and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on
					the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The
					first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes
					from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum
					used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested.
					Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"
					by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form,
					accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H.
					Rackham.
